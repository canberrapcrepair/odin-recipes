        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone needs a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine! The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. It's perfect for a quick midweek meal though if you have the time to simmer this Meat Sauce for a couple of hours, you'll take it from seriously delish to OMG this is amazing!!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>500g beef minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (125ml) beef stock</li>
            <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
            <li>800g crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
            <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
            <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 - 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 - 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce.</li>
            <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti - though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
        </ol>
