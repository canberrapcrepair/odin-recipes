        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone needs a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine! The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. It's perfect for a quick midweek meal though if you have the time to simmer this Meat Sauce for a couple of hours, you'll take it from seriously delish to OMG this is amazing!!</p>
